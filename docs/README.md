# vue-cytoscape

## What is this

This is a `vue` wrapper for [cytoscape.js](http://js.cytoscape.org).

## Why

We all love `vue` for creating user interfaces and `cytoscape.js` as a graph visualization library. Wouldn't be nice if we can create a reusable`vue` component that exposes `cytoscape.js` api? This is what this plugin is about.

## Support

If you have any issue please feel free to use the [Issues](https://github.com/rcarcasses/vue-cytoscape/issues) page.
